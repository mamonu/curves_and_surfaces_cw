#### a blast from the past

My 2004 Curves and Surfaces coursework from the MSc in CG and VE i attended that year.

Its a MFC Windows app that can draw certain kinds of curves.

### Implemented:

1.	Bezier Curve using approximation.
2.	Quadratic BSpline using standard knots.
3.	Cubic BSpline using standard knots.
4.	Nurbs using standard knots and order 4.
5.	Hermite curves.
6.	Bezier Surface 3. Uses 3 points for each point given.
7.	Bezier Surface 4. Uses 4 points for each point given.
8.	Quadratic BSpline Surface using standard knots.
9.	Cubic BSpline Surface using standard knots.
10.	Nurbs Surface using standard knots and order 4.
11.	Revolution Surface using a Bezier Curve.
12.	Four view ports for Orthographic Top view, Front view and Side view and Perspective view.
13.	Addition of control points, deletion of control points, modification of control points, and insertion of control points between two control points. 
14.	Zoom in, zoom out, yaw and pitch of the perspective view.






### Menu Options

There are four main menus
1.	Select
2.	Points
3.	Display
4.	View port

Select:

In this menu option the user selects which type of curves and surface he wishes to make. 
This is the first thing the user has to do to proceed further. 
This menu lists all the different curves and surfaces available for the user to draw.

Points:

This menu deals with the points. Following are the sub-menu of this
1.	Add: This allows the user to add points to create curves and surfaces. Using mouse left click.
2.	Modify: This allows user to select the point and drag it to its new position. Using mouse left click and mouse move.
3.	Delete: This allows user to delete the selected point. Point is selected using left click.
4.	Insert: This allows inserting a control point between two control points. Using mouse left click.
5.	Increase Weight: This option is valid only for nurbs curves and surfaces and allows increasing the weight of the selected control point. Using mouse left click.
